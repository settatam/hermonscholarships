        <p>Children in Nigeria face enormous difficulties in getting an education. Secondary school attendance is not funded by the government. The students must pay about $600 each year to attend school, but most rural families earn less than $300 annually. Moreover, sending a child to school deprives the family of his or her labor. Girls are less likely than boys to be educated and may be subjected child Labour.</p>

<p>In this environment, many young people lose hope. Many recognize the benefits of an education, but they have no choice but to rely on the generosity of “well-wishers” to make it possible.</p>

<p>Hermon Scholarships provides elementary and high school scholarships to needy children in all states in Nigeria. We currently support about 100 students in Nigeria. Students are chosen for their academic potential, motivation, need, and desire to work for the betterment of their people. We provide funds for tuition at high-quality boarding schools in addition to books, uniforms, mosquito nets,sanitary products, allowances for field trips, math equipment, and tutoring when necessary. We monitor the students’ performance to ensure that they continue to take full advantage of their educational opportunities.</p>

<p>An educated person has the potential to go on to university and a good job; they can also serve as an invaluable village resource, as a reader, a negotiator in markets, and an advocate for their people in a rapidly changing world.</p>
